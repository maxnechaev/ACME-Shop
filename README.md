# ACME Shop sample app build on MEAN stack

You will need 2 servers and MongoDB running for this application.

`git clone git@github.com:maxnechaev/ACME-Shop.git`

## Run the following command in one terminal window

`cd ACME-Shop/backend`

`npm i`

After installation is complete start the server:

`npm run dev`

## Run the following command in the second terminal window

`cd ACME-Shop/frontend`

`npm i`

After installation is complete start the server:

`npm run dev`

`ng serve -o`


Result can look something like this:

!["ACME-Shop"](https://github.com/maxnechaev/ACME-Shop/frontend/src/assets/screenshots/img4.png)

- edit warehouse,
!["acme-shop"](https://github.com/maxnechaev/ACME-Shop/frontend/src/assets/screenshots/img5.png)

- edit each product,
!["acme-shop"](https://github.com/maxnechaev/ACME-Shop/frontend/src/assets/screenshots/img6.png)

- send the order by email.
!["acme-shop"](https://github.com/maxnechaev/ACME-Shop/frontend/src/assets/screenshots/img7.png)
